**Developer:**
Nathan Nguyen

#Description:
In the game, bricks are form in collumns and rows on the screen. A ball  will drop down and once it hits the paddle the ball will travel across the screen, bouncing off the the sides of the wall on the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces  in the opposite directions and the brick is destroyed. The player has a paddle to manipulate the bouncing direction of the ball, avoiding the botton of the screen.

The player must destroy the wall of bricks from above by deflecting the bouncing ball with a paddle. The paddle moves horizontally and is controlled with left and right arrow keys.The player wins when all the bricks have been smashed and loses when they are out of lives.
